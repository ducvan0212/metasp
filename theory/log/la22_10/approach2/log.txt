=== Compute gamma
=== Compute potential
=== Compute Pi_x
=== Compute epsilon
Done!
Result in epsilon_plus.lp and epsilon_minus.lp
For the following program:
&diff{b-0}<=5.
&diff{0-b}<= -5.
a :- &diff{b-0} <= 10.
Answer set: dl(b,5)
The AS doesn't contain a, so epsilon_plus for ASP will be potential_plus
